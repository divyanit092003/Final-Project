# covidGeospatialAnalysis

This R package provides functions for geospatial analysis of COVID-19 data. COVID-19 has impacted the whole world and creating this package allowed me to visually see the trends.

## Installation

You can install the package from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("divyanit092003/covidGeospatialAnalysis")
